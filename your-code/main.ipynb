[...] PEF are expected to grow continuously by an average of 65% until 2029. [...] The increase in production capacity from 2023 to 2024 is mainly due to the expansion of PLA capacity and epoxy resin production in Asia, as well as a global increase in PUR production.

      "# Summary\n",
      "The search for truly bio-based, fully biodegradable materials that can replace oil-based plastics has led to the development of several promising materials. These include Polylactic Acid (PLA), Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), bio-based Polypropylene (PP), and Polyethylene Furanoate (PEF). These materials are derived from renewable resources, involve minimal chemical modification, and are fully degradable in natural or composting environments without persistent toxins.\n",
